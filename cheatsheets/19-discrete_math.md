# Discrete Math

**Rule of sum.** the number of ways to choose one element from one of two disjoint sets is the sum of the cardinalities of the sets.

**Rule of product.** the number of ways to choose an ordered pair is the number of ways to choose the first element times the number of ways to choose the second element.


## Probability

Sample space `S` the set of all possible outcomes/events.

```
P(A and B)  =  P(A)P(B)                   if A and B are independent
P(A xor B)  =  P(A) + P(B)                if A and B are mutually exclusive
P(A  or B)  =  P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)   if A and B are not mutually exclusive
P(A | B)    =  P(A and B) / P(B)
P(A and B)  =  P(A|B)P(B)  =  P(B|A)P(A)
```

```
Permutation:  P(n, r)  =  n! / (n - k)!
Combination:  C(n, r)  =  n! / (n - k)! k!
```
