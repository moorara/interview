# Computer Networks

## Protocol Layers

  * a **protocol** is an agreement between the communicating parties on how communication is to proceed.
  * Most networks are organized as a stack of **layers**, each one built upon the one below it. Between each pair of adjacent layers is an interface.
  * Each layer passes data and control information to the layer immediately below it, until the lowest layer is reached.
  * Each instance of a protocol talks virtually to its peer using the protocol (horizontal).
  * Each instance of a protocol uses only the services of the lower layer (vertical).
  * Lower layer wraps higher layer content, adding its own information to make a new datagram for delivery.
  * Each layer adds its own header. Trailers, compression, encryption, and segmentation and reassembly may also be involved.
  * Layering provide abstraction and modularity, but it also adds overhead and hides information and details.

## Network Protocols:

  * **ARP**
    * Layer: Link
    * The Address Resolution Protocol is used for converting of network layer addresses (IPv4) into link layer addresses (MAC).
  * **NDP**
    * Layer: Link
    * The Neighbor Discovery Protocol is used with Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6).
      * Discovery of other nodes on the link
      * Determining the link layer addresses of other nodes
      * Finding available routers and DNS servers
  * **ICMP, ICMPv6**

      * Echo Request
      * Echo Reply
      * Source Quench
      * Time Exceeded
  * **IPv4, IPv6**
    * Layer: Internet/Network
    * The Internet Protocol defines packet structures and addressing methods that are used to label the datagram with source and destination.
    * IP is responsible for delivering packets from the source host to the destination host solely based on the IP addresses in the packet headers.
  * **IPsec**
    * Layer: Internet/Network
    * Internet Protocol security uses cryptographic security services to protect communications over Internet Protocol networks.
      * Data origin authentication
      * Data integrity
      * Data confidentiality (encryption)
    * IPsec can be configured to operate either in Transport mode or in Tunnel mode.
  * **TCP**
    * Layer: Transport
    * TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of datagrams between hosts/applications communicating over an IP network.
    * TCP is a reliable stream delivery service which guarantees all bytes received will be identical with bytes sent and in the correct order.
    * A technique known as positive acknowledgment with retransmission is used to guarantee reliability of packet transfers.
    * The sender maintains a timer for the packet, and retransmits a packet if the timer expires before the packet has been acknowledged.
    * TCP is optimized for accurate delivery rather than timely delivery, and therefore, TCP sometimes incurs relatively long delays.
  * **UDP**
    * Layer: Transport
    * UDP uses a simple connectionless transmission and exposes the host/application to any unreliability of the underlying network protocol.
    * UDP has no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection.
    * UDP is for purposes where error checking and correction is either not necessary or is performed in the application.
    * Real-time and time-sensitive applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for delayed packets.
    * UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination.
  * **DHCP**
    * Layer: Application
    * DHCP is a protocol used on IP networks for dynamically distributing network configuration parameters, such as IP addresses.
      * DHCPDISCOVER: the client broadcasts messages on the network subnet. A DHCP client may also request its last-known IP address.
      * DHCPOFFER: the server reserves an IP address for the client, makes a lease offer, and broadcast it.
      * DHCPREQUEST: the client broadcasts a message requesting the offered address.
      * DHCPACK: the server sends an acknowledgement to the client including the lease duration and any other configuration information.
  * **DNS**
    * Layer: Application
    * The Domain Name System is a hierarchical distributed naming system for hosts, services, or any resource connected to the Internet.
    * DNS translates domain names, which can be easily memorized by humans, to the numerical IP addresses.
  * **TLS/SSL**
    * Layer: Application
    * The TLS protocol provide authentication, integrity and confidentiality (encryption) for client-server applications.
    * Other protocols can operate either with or without TLS/SSL.
    * Client and server negotiate a stateful connection by a handshaking procedure to agree on parameters used during the secure session.

### Private Networks:

  * A private network is a network that uses a private IP address space.
  * Private IP addresses are commonly used for home, office, and enterprise local area networks.
  * IPv4 Private Address Spaces:
    * 24-bit block:
      * Address range: `10.0.0.0` - `10.255.255.255`
      * single class A network
    * 20-bit block:
      * Address range: `172.16.0.0` - `172.31.255.255`
      * 16 class B networks
    * 16-bit block:
      * Address range: `192.168.0.0` - `192.168.255.255`
      * 256 class C networks


## Network Address Translation:

  * NAT is a methodology for mapping one IP address space into another.
  * NAT modifies network address information in Internet Protocol (IP) packet headers while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.
  * There are three different types of NAT implementation:
    * **Static NAT**
      * Static NAT is one-to-one mapping of a private IP address to a public IP address.
      * Static NAT is useful when a network device inside a private network needs to be accessible from internet.
    * **Dynamic NAT**
      * Dynamic NAT establishes a one-to-one mapping between a private IP address to a public IP address.
      * Dynamic NAT is mapping of a private IP address to a public IP address from a group of public IP addresses called as NAT pool.
      * The public to private mapping may vary based on the available public IP address in NAT pool.
    * **PAT/Overloading**
      * Port Address Translation is another type of dynamic NAT which can map multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address.
      * When a client from inside network communicate to a host in the internet, the router changes the source port number with another.
      * When the router receives from internet, it will refer the port mappings table and forward the data packet to the original sender.

  * Port forwarding is an application of network address translation (NAT).
  * It redirects a communication request from one IP address and port number to another while the packets are traversing a network gateway.
  * It is used to make services on a host residing on a protected or internal network available to hosts on the other side of gateway (external network).
  * Port forwarding can be divided into the following types:
    * Local port forwarding
    * Remote port forwarding
    * Dynamic port forwarding


## Network Topologies:

  * Bus Network
  * Star Network
  * Ring Network
  * Mesh Network
  * Tree Network
  * Hybrid Network


## Network Devices:

  * **Repeater**
    * A device which amplifies or regenerates digital signals received while sending them from one part of a network into another.
    * A repeater works at the physical layer (layer 1) of the OSI model.
  * **Bridge**
    * A bridge connects multiple network segments.
    * In the OSI model, bridging is performed in the first two layers, below the network layer.
  * **Hub**
    * A hub connects multiple Ethernet segments, making them act as a single segment.
    * A hub works at the physical layer (layer 1) of the OSI model.
    * A hub re-broadcasts any data entering any port to all other ports.
  * **Switch**
    * A switch connects devices together on a network, by using packet switching to receive, process and forward data to the destination device.
    * A switch works at the link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model.
    * A switch splits the network traffic and sends it to different destinations using hardware addresses rather than to all systems on the network.
  * **Router**
    * A router forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the "traffic directing" functions on the Internet.
    * A router works at the network layer (layer 3) pf the OSI model.
    * The routers exchange information about destination addresses using a dynamic routing protocol.
