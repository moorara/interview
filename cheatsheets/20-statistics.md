# Statistics

## Concepts

### Experiment

  - Each experiment **run** is a **test**.
  - An experiment is a series of **runs** in which changes are made to the input variables of a process or system.
  - An experiment **objective** is to determine the influence that misc factors have on the output response of the system.
  - The general approach to planning and conducting an experiment is called the **strategy of experimentation**.
    - **Best-Guess Approach**
    - **One-Factor-at-a-Time (OFAT)**
      - The OFAT method consists of selecting a starting point or baseline set of levels for each factor,
          and then successively varying each factor over its range with the other factors held constant at the baseline level.
      - The major disadvantage of the OFAT strategy is that it fails to consider any possible interaction between the factors.
    - **Factorial Experiment**
      - The correct approach to dealing with several factors is to conduct a factorial experiment.
      - This is an experimental strategy in which factors are varied together, instead of one at a time.
      - Each factor (combination) can be **replicated** in an experiment design.
      - **Fractional Factorial Experiment**: a variation of the basic factorial design in which only a subset of the runs is used.
  - **Experiment Design**
    - The three basic principles of experimental design are **randomization**, **replication**, and **blocking**.
      Sometimes we add the **factorial principle** to these three.
      - Randomization refers to the allocation of the experimental material and the order of individual runs of the experiment to be determined randomly.
      - Replication refers to an independent repeat run of each factor combination.
      - Blocking is a design technique to improve the precision with which comparisons among the factors of interest are made.
        - Often blocking is used to reduce or eliminate the variability transmitted from **nuisance factors**.
        - A **block** is a set of relatively homogeneous experimental conditions.
        - Each level of the nuisance factor becomes a block.
        - Then the experimenter divides the observations from the statistical design into groups that are run in each block.
