# Software Architecture

## Microservices

### Domain-Driven Design

  * **Bounded Context**
    * A design technique for **scoping** microservices.
    * Each **bounded context** represents a **domain function** or **microservice**.

### Design Principles

  * **Business Domain Centric**
    * Bounded Context
  * **High Cohesion**
    * Single Focus/Responsibility
  * **Autonomous**
    * Loose Coupling
      * Contract-based
      * Technology agnostic API
      * Avoid client libraries
      * Avoid sharing between services
    * Stateless
    * Independently Changeable
    * Independently Deployable
  * **Resilience**
    * Multi-Instance
    * Design For Failure
      * Fail Fast
      * Timeout
      * Retry
      * Circuit Breaking
    * Degrade Functionality
    * Default Functionality
  * **Observable**
    * Centralized Metrics
    * Centralized Logging
    * Distributed Tracing
  * **Automated**
    * Continuous Integration
    * Continuous Delivery
    * Automated Testing
    * Automated Monitring/Alerting

### Communications

  * **Synchronous**
    * RPC
    * HTTP
    * REST
  * **Asynchronous**
    * Async API Call using Callbacks
    * Event-based using Message Brokers
    * Competing Workers Pattern
    * Fanout Pattern

### API Composition

  * Chained Pattern
  * Proxy (API Gateway) Pattern
  * Aggregate Pattern
    * Front-end Aggregator
    * Back-end Aggregator

### Security

  * Defend in Depth
  * Reduce Attack Surface
  * Principle of Least Privilege
  * Access Control
  * Secure Communications


## Serverless

  * **Benefits**
    * Scalability
    * Cost & Utilization
    * Managed Infrastructure
    * SaaS Integrations
    * Internet of Things
    * Developer Productivity
  * **Drawbacks**
    * Debugging
    * Obscure Infrastructure
    * Opinionated Development Process
